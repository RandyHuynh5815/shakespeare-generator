# shakespeare-generator

In this workshop, you have learned about Markov chains. We will now put your skills to work in order to make a Shakespearean autocomplete/text generator. To get started, download the github repository. Most of the instructions will be in the Jupyter notebook, but to setup, within the folder enter the following snippet in the terminal.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Make sure that you have Jupyter Notebook or some extension that uses Jupyter Notebook. I hope you enjoy you enjoy working on this project!
